<p>I'm a Mathematician and Computer Scientist currently working in the Spanish Stock Market <i>BME</i> (Bolsas y Mercados Espa√±oles) developing blockchain solutions.</p>

<p>As I continue to deepen in the different blockchain solutions, I like to share my own tutorials and tools that made me win the battle against the lack of documentation.</p>

<p>I hope you find this blog useful and for any error you may encounter, you can always make a pull request at this blog's <a href="https://github.com/jlcs-es/blockchainblog">GitHub repository</a></p>
